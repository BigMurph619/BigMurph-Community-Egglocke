# Make Your Eggs

1) To start with, you will need to download [PkHex](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/).
2) Extract from the zip and you should be left with an exe called PKHeX.
3) Download [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.8-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore) if you dont already have it.
4) Then open the EXE, Defender might pop up, click more, then run.

> As of the 8th of september 2024 there are no real security issues with this file, [Virustotal result](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1bd37bea42266823a6a9e6ef348bc20fb360a7ee5733d534738a1331b9733acf)

5) Once you have opened PkHex go to options, settings then at the top **change blank save settings to "GO VOTE IN DISCORD"** then close out of settings.
6) **VERY IMPORTANT** Before you start looking through the options you can change, MAKE SURE TO TICK **Is Egg**
7) You can now change the Species to the pokemon of your choice and nickname it however you like.
8) Look through the various choices and make the Egg you want.
9) Ensure you include YOUR TWITCH USERNAME as the "OT" (Original Trainer) in the "OT/Misc" tab so I know who made the egg!
10) When you are done, the image in the top left, drag and drop it into a file or your desktop this should make a pk3 file.
11) Go into the Big Murphs Discord and in egglocke submission post your pk3 file.

**Done you can post two pk3 files for the event**
